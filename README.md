 [---> check out the live project](https://annakrolikowska.github.io/js-payment-form/)

Simple project coded to improve my skills in **SCSS** and **Vanilla Javascript**, and correct mapping of design from **Figma** to code.

  - The form is designed to ensure all fields are filled, and the credit card number meets the requirements for credit card number validators. The form is validated after each character input.

  - To proceed, the "Next step" button should only be active in the case of a properly validated form. If the user clicks the active "Next step" button, a standard "Success" alert should appear.

  - This project is designed to be displayed correctly on all types of devices.
